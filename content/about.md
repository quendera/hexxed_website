<h3 class="major">About hexxed</h3>

hexxed is a videogame developed from the ground up to study how humans strategize to solve complex problems.

By understanding this, we can improve the Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms that exist and create new ones that adopt more human-like strategies in solving societal and individual problems.

While humans are astute at solving very complex problems in a very fast manner, even extremely powerful AI's seem to have difficulty in doing so. In fact, it was only in the last years that computers defeated humans in games of Chess and Go. In hexxed, you will be put to the test!

**Can you avoid getting hexxed and beat the AI?**
