### Who is the app owner?
Gautam Agarwal

### What data is being collected? How is that data being collected?
During gameplay, each user action, and its timing, is logged. In addition, the time zone, user language, IP address, device model, unique device identifier, and operating system version are collected. This data is sent to our server every time the user completes a level. Users can also access an optional survey where they are asked questions about gender, age, and personality.
### What is the Legal basis for the collection? (e.g consent, necessary for your service, legal obligation etc.) 
Users are asked for consent the first time they open the app. All data collection procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal.

### For which specific purposes are the data collected? Analytics? Email Marketing?
We use the data in an anonymous fashion for a scientific research project whose objective is to model playersâ€™ decision making process, and how it correlates to the characteristics of the player (their gender, age, personality, geographic location, and native language). The IP address is collected to identify the geographic location of subjects, and their unique device ID is used to associate all level attempts to the same (anonymous) player. There are no additional financial or commercial interests. The data is not used by us for any other purposes.

### Which third parties will have access to the information? Will any third party collect data through widgets (e.g. social buttons) and integrations (e.g. Facebook Connect)?
No third parties will have access to the data collected.

### What rights do users have? Can they request to see the data you have on them, can they request to rectify, erase or block their data? (under European regulations most of this is mandatory).
Users can request to withdraw from the study and have their data erased.
To do so, please email us at thehexxedgame@gmail.com and include the numbers in the game's ABOUT tab.
Upon request, no record of the data will be kept.

### Description of process for notifying users and visitors of changes or updates to the privacy policy
Any updates to this policy will be posted on our website (hexxed.io)

### Effective date of the privacy policy
