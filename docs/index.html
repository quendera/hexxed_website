<h3 id="what-data-is-being-collected-how-is-that-data-being-collected">What data is being collected? How is that data being collected?</h3>
<p>During gameplay, each user action, and its timing, is logged. In addition, the time zone, user language, IP address, device model, unique device identifier, and operating system version are collected. This data is sent to our server every time the user completes a level. Users can also access an optional survey where they are asked questions about gender, age, and personality.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-legal-basis-for-the-collection-eg-consent-necessary-for-your-service-legal-obligation-etc">What is the Legal basis for the collection? (e.g consent, necessary for your service, legal obligation etc.)</h3>
<p>Users are asked for consent the first time they open the app. All data collection procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
<h3 id="for-which-specific-purposes-are-the-data-collected-analytics-email-marketing">For which specific purposes are the data collected? Analytics? Email Marketing?</h3>
<p>We use the data in an anonymous fashion for a scientific research project whose objective is to model playersâ€™ decision making process, and how it correlates to the characteristics of the player (their gender, age, personality, geographic location, and native language). The IP address is collected to identify the geographic location of subjects, and their unique device ID is used to associate all level attempts to the same (anonymous) player. There are no additional financial or commercial interests. The data is not used by us for any other purposes.</p>

Will any third party collect data through widgets (e.g. social buttons) and integrations (e.g. Facebook Connect)?</h3>
<p>No third parties will have access to the data collected.</p>

<p>Users can request to withdraw from the study and have their data erased.
To do so, please email us at <a href="mailto:thehexxedgame@gmail.com">thehexxedgame@gmail.com</a> and include the numbers in the game&rsquo;s ABOUT tab.
Upon request, no record of the data will be kept.</p>

  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>You routinely make choices that are much more complex than they seem. Right now, in choosing to play this game you may wonder: Is it worth my time? Could I be doing something better? Your memories, desires, and imagination weave together in a mysterious way as you ponder. So, how do you choose?</p>
<p>We made hexxed to study this question. We designed the game so that it is simple enough to study scientifically, yet complex enough to challenge the mental abilities of human players. Now we aim to collect data from tens of thousands of players like you. Why? Because mapping the creative impulse that fuels intelligence requires many repeated observations. Each of you arrives at the game with a unique history and tendencies, meaning that you can interpret the game in highly diverse and fluid ways. Nonetheless, based on our work in the lab, we believe that the commonalities across players will outweigh the differences, allowing us to map a territory of intelligent play, and see how people move through it.</p>
<p>Within one year, we will share our findings here, so that you may see how you and your fellow humans solve problems.</p>
